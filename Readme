Hello to whoever is reading
This is a small set of projects I have worked on in the past year or so.
It includes a controller design and simulation for a Tape Drive system.

The other controls project was for a furuta pendulum.

It also containes a threaded opencv executable that implements some simple transforms.`

As well as that there is some less abstracted c code for a microcontroller project where my partner and I were supposed to implement a simple logger using pretty barebones existing code.

Also a Kalman filter simulation project. 

One thing I want to note if your reading this is that most all of this was rushed, and thus minimal time was allocated for proper coding practice and commenting.
